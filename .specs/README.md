# Specs

This project uses [KISS Specs](https://github.com/stilliard/kiss-specs) — simple markdown feature specifications for AI-assisted development.

Each `.md` file in this folder describes a feature: what it does, how it's built, and how to verify it works. Frontmatter provides status and keywords for discovery.

Template: `_template.md`
